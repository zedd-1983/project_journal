# Easysleep project overview

Easysleep is a project that aims to help parents to solve children's bedwetting issues.
The idea is that one device (k64f in this case) monitors when this accident happen and
on subsequent nights tries to notify another device (k64f in this case as well) around
the same time to try to wake up the sleeping person or disturb his/hers sleep enough so
they can go to the toilet themselves as a precaution. This is going to be achieved by
using a vibration motor, buzzer and/or a relay that would be able to switch on lights in
the room.

The system uses FreeRTOS to manage tasks.

NOTE: This project is a final year project hence I cannot accept any contributions to my 
code should somebody wish to join. Thank you anyway.
