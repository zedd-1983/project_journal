# Bed Wetting Research Notes  

Ninety percent of the kids think they are the only ones wetting the bed. 5 to 7  
million of children wet the bed some or most nights, twice as many boys as girls.  
After the age of 5, about 15% of children continue to wet the bed and by the age  
of 10, 95% of children are dry at night.

There is no one single cause of bed-wetting. Majority of bedwetting is inherited.  
3 out of 4 kids either a parent or a first-degree relative also wet the bed in   
childhood.

### Usual bedwetting suspects  
**Delayed bladder maturation** - the brain and bladder learn to communicate with  
each other during sleep, might take longer in some kids  
**Low ani-diuretic hormone (ADH)** - this hormone tells the kidnes to make less  
urine. Some kids release less of this hormone while asleep. More urine means   
more bedwetting.  
**Deep sleepers** - some children sleep so deeply that their brain doesn't get  
the signal that their bladder is full  
**Smaller "functional" bladder** - during sleep it sends signal earlier that it  
is full   
**Constipation** - full bowels press on the bladder and can cause uncrontrolled  
bladder contractions during waking or sleep.  

Bedwetting caused by medical problems is genuinely rare - 3% or less. Majority of  
kids who are wet at night have nothing medically wrong with them. Psychological  
stress is a common cause.

### Treatment  
- encouraging a child to pee before bedtime
- restriction of fluids intake before bed
- covering the mattress with plastic
- bed-wetting alarms
- bladder stretching exercises
- medication
