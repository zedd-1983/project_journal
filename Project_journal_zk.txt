I have started my project journal on GitHub today. The plan for this week in terms of 
the project is to finalize my project idea, discuss it with my supervisor and few other 
lecturers and write up a proposal to be submitted by Sunday 6th.

During my last week I have setup the MCUXpresso and FreeRTOS and tested everything compiles
and works. I have created and submitted the project proposal.
Plan for this week is to get SystemView working with K64F to monitor the FreeRTOS and to
start working on the moisture detection. This will likely be an external interrupt.
