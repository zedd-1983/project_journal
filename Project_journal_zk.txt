I have started my project journal on GitHub today. The plan for this week in terms of 
the project is to finalize my project idea, discuss it with my supervisor and few other 
lecturers and write up a proposal to be submitted by Sunday 6th.

During my last week I have setup the MCUXpresso and FreeRTOS and tested everything compiles
and works. I have created and submitted the project proposal.
Plan for this week is to get SystemView working with K64F to monitor the FreeRTOS and to
start working on the moisture detection. This will likely be an external interrupt.

I have order two K64F development boards off Brian today along with a J-Link EDU debugging
probe that will help me to monitor the behaviour of the FreeRTOS using SystemView. Waiting
for confirmation from Brian that the order is OK and expected delivery times. I have also 
acquired 2 Bluetooth modules to get the wireless communication going. Didn't get to work on
the boards at all unfortunately but giving myself this week the get the external interrupt 
going and start working on the RTC for timekeeping. Will probably have to talk to Paul or 
Niall about the design of the FreeRTOS system and it's tasks
